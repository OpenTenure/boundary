            <h1>Welcome to SOLA Community Server</h1>
            <p>
                Using SOLA Community server you can <h:link outcome="user/registration">enrol</h:link> as a
                Community Member and view recordings made by community members.
                User enrolment can be done online and once you complete enrolment the Community Technologist
                will review it and approve. Upon approval a confirmation code will be sent to your e-mail address.
                You will then need to activate your enrolment request, by following the received link.
                Another way is to contact your Community Technologist and they will enroll
                you as a Community Server user.
                <p></p>
                All Community Member enrolments are subject to review and approval by the Community Server Technologist
                and the SMSMCL project team.
                <p></p>
                If you are already enrolled, use <h:link outcome="login">Login page</h:link> to login into the system.
            </p>
